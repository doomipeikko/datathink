                    Initially I wanted to create an external CSV or XML file and just have JavaScript or Python read from that file. However, as the project moved on, I realized that I don't have a good enough of a grasp of either language to accomplish this, and really not enough time to learn either. So my data is, instead, included in the code itself. Possibly one day I will come back to this project and work on it more as I don't like to leave things hanging...
                </p>
                <p>I've included both the XML and CSV files here since the properly formatted datasets were a required component of this project.
