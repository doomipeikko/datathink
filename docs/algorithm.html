                <h1>The Algorithm</h1>
<p>My algorithm is based on the Periodic Table of elements. I wanted to design an algorithm that asks a user to input an element, compares the input to a predetermined dataset and if a match is found, displays the stats of that element. The application will accept either the element's name or the element's symbol.</p>
                
<p>I also wanted the application to print an error message if a non-existing element was typed (or if the element's name was misspelled).</p>
                
<p>For easier use, I wanted the app to keep going until the user was satisfied and decided to end the application themselves by using the Quit command. For this, I added a "Quit" option for Python. For the JavaScript version I realized this wasn't necessary as the application would keep going until the user exits the page.</p>
                
<p>There's also a quick debugger that converts the input to the correct format (capitalized first letter) so JavaScript/Python can understand the user input without immediately throwing "element not found" if the user types <b>ca</b> instead of <b>Ca</b> (for Calcium), for example.</p>
