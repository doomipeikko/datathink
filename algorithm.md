# The Algorithm

My algorithm is based on the Periodic Table of elements. I wanted to design an algorithm that asks a user to input an element and then displays the stats of that element. I also wanted the program to print an error message if a non-existing element was asked for so I used an **if-else comparison**. For easier use I wanted the app to keep going until the user was satisfied and decided to end the program themselves. For this, I programmed a **while loop**. There's also a quick debugger that transforms the user input to lower-case so Python can understand the user without immediately throwing an error message if someone types **ca** instead of **Ca**.
