# Datalogical Thinking Project
This GitHub page is the final project of the [*Datalogical Thinking*](https://www.hb.se/globalassets/global/international-office/kursplaner-ischool/ht23_datalogical-thinking-c3mdt1.pdf) course.

## About the Assignment
For this assignment, we were asked to work together in a group to curate a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. We were asked to publish their dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on the project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages.

I know this was meant to be a group project, but both I and my one-year-old have been sick with Covid (**how retro!**) for the past two weeks. As such, I have not been able to focus on schoolwork very much during the day and I feel like I would have been a very bad teammate in this state. As I already have some experience in programming, it felt like it would be less of a hassle to complete the project by myself than to spend countless hours collaborating and negotiating the details of the project before we even get it off the ground running...

## About the Algorithm
I chose to work with the Periodic Table of Elements. I designed and programmed a quick flashcard app that asks a user to input an element and then displays that element's stats. This project is dedicated to my 8th grade Chemistry teacher, who failed me that year because I could not memorize the whole Periodic Table by heart even though he kept insisting that we wouldn't always have access to a computer to check out element stats (yes, I'm **that** old). The times they are a-changing, Mr. Toshner ;)
