                <h2>Datalogical Thinking Project</h2>
This GitHub page is the final project of the <a class="text" href="https://www.hb.se/globalassets/global/international-office/kursplaner-ischool/ht23_datalogical-thinking-c3mdt1.pdf" target="_blank">Datalogical Thinking</a> course.
                
                <h2>About the Assignment</h2>
For this assignment, we were asked to work together in a group to curate a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. We were asked to publish their dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on the project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages.

                <h2>About the Algorithm</h2>
I chose to work with the Periodic Table of Elements. I designed an algorithm that asks a user to input an element and if the input matches an entry in the predetermined dataset, the algorithm displays that element's stats.<br><br>
                
This project is dedicated to my 8th grade Chemistry teacher, who failed me that year because I could not memorize the whole Periodic Table by heart even though he kept insisting that we wouldn't always have access to a computer to check out element stats (yes, I'm <b>that</b> old). So here's to you, Mr. Toshner - <i>the times they are a-changing</i> &#x1F609;
                <h2>About the Application</h2>
I programmed a JavaScipt application based on my algorithm. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology so I have a little experience with programming. It's been about 10 years, though, since then and my skills are a little bit rusty. The code might not be the prettiest or the most optimized, but it <i>is</i> functional. I also attempted to program the same application in Python, which I've been tinkering with for about a year now. <a class="text" href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a class="text" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a> have been my holy grail and saving grace in getting these programs up and running.
